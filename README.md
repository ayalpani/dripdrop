## Install

```
$ npm install dripdrop
```

## Why Yet Another State Management Library for React?

React Context, Redux, Zustand, MobX, Recoil, Valtio ... I tried them all in projects big and small. None of them sparked joy, so I built my own tiny but powerful state management solution.

## dripdrop...

- ... doesn't need React Context
- ... allows for super **granular updates**, only re-render if it's really needed
- ... consists of &lt; 60 lines of dependency-free Vanilla TS code. ðŸ‘‰ [jump right in](./src/index.ts)
- ... implements a simple **observer pattern** and is easy to comprehend

## A simple example:

## Debugging

To get a list of all subscriptions in your app, open the developer console and paste this:

> \_\_dripdrop.getSubscriptionCallbacks()
